## Prompt

Create a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course\n\nThe future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, we want you to write a textbook to teach a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the constitution for your "Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course".\n\nHere's a summary:\n*   **New version**: 1.0.0\n*   **Rationale**: Initial creation of the project constitution.\n*   **Files flagged for manual follow-up**: None at this stage, but dependent templates (\`plan-template.md\`, \`spec-template.md\`, \`tasks-template.md\`, and command files) may require updates to align with the new principles.\n\nSuggested commit message: \`docs: initialize constitution to v1.0.0 (initial textbook constitution)\`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution created for textbook project.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 1 file modified: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will likely proceed with planning or specification.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the constitution based on user input, and filled a new template with project specific values. Ensured all placeholders were replaced correctly.
