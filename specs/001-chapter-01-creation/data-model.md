# Data Model for Chapter 01 Creation

This feature involves simple file system operations (creating a directory and a markdown file) and does not require a complex data model. The entities are:

- **Chapter 01 Directory**: A container on the file system.
- **Chapter 01 Markdown File**: A text file with markdown content.

No specific data schema or relationships are needed beyond standard file system structures.
