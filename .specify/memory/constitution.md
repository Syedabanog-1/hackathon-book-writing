# Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Accuracy
All content MUST be clear, concise, and technically accurate. Explanations should be easy to understand for the target audience (university level students in engineering/computer science). All technical terms MUST be defined and used consistently.

### II. Practical Application
The textbook SHOULD emphasize practical application through hands-on exercises, labs, and projects. Theoretical concepts MUST be reinforced with tangible examples and opportunities for implementation.

### III. Real-world Relevance
Content MUST be relevant to current industry practices, research, and real-world applications of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Case studies and examples from actual robotic systems and AI implementations SHOULD be included.

### IV. Up-to-date Content
The textbook SHOULD be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect advancements in the rapidly evolving fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Mechanisms for incorporating new research and technologies MUST be considered.

### V. Modular Structure
The textbook MUST have a modular structure, allowing instructors to easily adapt it for courses of varying lengths and focus areas. Each chapter or module SHOULD be self-contained where possible, with clear learning objectives.

## Content Guidelines

All chapters MUST follow a consistent structure, including learning objectives, theoretical explanations, practical examples, exercises, and summaries. Visual aids (diagrams, illustrations, code snippets) SHOULD be used extensively to enhance understanding. The technical depth should be appropriate for a university-level course.

## Review and Iteration Process

The content MUST undergo rigorous technical review by subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and completeness. Pedagogical review SHOULD also be conducted to assess clarity, effectiveness for teaching, and alignment with learning objectives. Feedback from reviews MUST be incorporated systematically.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments to this constitution require documented rationale, review, and approval by project stakeholders. Versioning MUST follow semantic versioning principles. Compliance with these principles WILL be periodically reviewed.
